## 🧠 Overview  

**AutoRebar** is a specialized structural engineering tool for automatic reinforcement (rebar) design and detailing. It streamlines the creation of reinforcement layouts for concrete elements such as walls, beams, columns, and slabs with high precision. The software helps engineers and draftsmen generate detailed reinforcement drawings faster while ensuring accuracy and compliance with design standards.

AutoRebar automates complex reinforcement rules and geometry, significantly reducing manual drafting time. It supports customizable rebar shapes, detailed annotations, bending schedules, and material summaries—making it suitable for both small projects and large-scale structural work.

Optimized for Windows-based workflows, AutoRebar integrates smoothly into professional design environments and enhances productivity in structural drafting tasks.
